# JAC Intranet

WordPress project for the Judicial Appointments Commission intranet.

This is based on the template and markup from JAC's old RedDot-powered intranet. Where possible, markup and assets have been 'lifted and shifted' from the old intranet.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.4+
* WordPress 4.3+
* node.js

4. Enable the theme "JAC Intranet" in the WordPress admin.
